Despite many acoustic, articulatory, and phonological studies of Advanced Tongue Root (ATR)
vowel contrasts and vowel harmony, studies of the perception of ATR contrasts by speakers of
languages with ATR vowel distinctions are lacking. This paper explores how vowels that differ
for ATR or height, or both, are distinguished by speakers of Akan, a Kwa language of Ghana.
We examine whether the phonologically contrastive status of the vowels impacts perception
or whether perception is driven by acoustic similarity. Results from two experiments reveal
that vowels that differ only for ATR are well distinguished, even those that are in an allophonic
relationship. Yet, vowels that are contrastive and differ by both ATR and height features, but are
acoustically similar, are poorly perceived. We suggest that these vowel contrasts constitute a
case of perceptual near-merger.

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

1 Introduction
Many languages in Africa are reported to have vowels that contrast for the feature [Advanced
Tongue Root] (ATR). This contrast is realized articulatorily as a distinction between an advanced
position of the tongue root, along with pharyngeal expansion, in opposition to a neutral (Hudu,

2014) or retracted position (Lindau, 1978).1 It is also commonly accompanied or identified by the
presence of vowel harmony for this feature. Indeed, ATR vowel harmony is especially common
within the Nilo-Saharan and Niger Congo phyla (Casali, 2008; Clements, 2007). Rolle, Lionnet,

and Faytak (2020) report that out of 681 languages in their Areal Linguistic Features of Africa

database, 358, or 53%, exhibit ATR vowel harmony. ATR vowel harmony has long contributed to

the development of phonological theoretical accounts of vowel harmony (Stewart, 1967, 1971,
1983; Schacter, 1969; Clements, 1981, 1984, 1985; Bakovic, 2000; Casali, 2008). Phoneticians

have also studied the articulation of ATR contrasts in African languages using a variety of
methods, including X-rays and ultrasound. Acoustic properties of the vowel contrasts have also
been extensively studied. Yet, despite such a large focus on ATR systems, and anecdotal reports
of difficulty perceiving distinctions between certain vowels, surprisingly little attention has been
paid to the perception of ATR contrasts, especially by speakers of languages with ATR harmony.

1.1 Articulation
Ladefoged (1964), investigating Igbo (Benue-Congo, Nigeria), was one of the first studies of the
articulation of ATR vowel contrasts using X-rays. Although he describes the distinction in the

cineradiographic tracings as involving the tongue body, Stewart (1967) interpreted these tracings,
combined with his own observations of chin lowering in Akan (Kwa, Ghana), as involving the
tongue root, with tongue body height changes as a natural consequence of advancing the tongue

root. He proposed the feature [Advanced Tongue Root]. Indeed, one can clearly see the retracted
and advanced positions of the tongue root in Ladefoged's images. This corroborates Pike (1947),
who speculated that pharyngeal modification leading to a deeper resonance in vowels could
be accomplished through forward position of the tongue body and root, larynx lowering, or

movement of the faucal pillars. Lindau (1978, 1979) used cineradiographic tracings for four

speakers of Akan (3 Akyem, 1 Asante). Lindau's results clearly indicate a more advanced tongue

root and a lower larynx for +ATR vowels than -ATR vowels, with concomitant expansion of
the pharynx. In contrast, -ATR vowels retract the tongue root and raise the larynx, leading to
a small pharyngeal space. Due to the pharyngeal expansion, she proposes the phonetic feature

[expanded] instead of [advanced tongue root] as it captures more of the articulatory properties.

The following diagram (Figure 1, reproduced from Lindau, 1978) displays X-ray tracings of

The phonological feature Retracted Tongue Root [RTR] is used in opposition to Advanced Tongue Root [ATR] by
some researchers instead of binary values of a single [ATR] feature (e.g., Pulleyblank, 2002). In addition, [RTR] has
been used for vowel distinctions in languages outside Africa to refer to tongue root distinctions, such as in Altaic
languages (Li, 1996; Kang & Ko, 2012; Kang, 2018).

eight vowels of Akan (Akyem dialect), showing the position of the jaw and the tongue root. It

can be seen that the +ATR vowels [i e u o] (IPA: i  e u o) show a more advanced tongue root
than their -ATR counterparts [   ] (IPA: i  e u o), but that the raised tongue body is similar

(note that  and  are alternate transcriptions for  and ).2 In an earlier study of one speaker

of the Akyem dialect, Lindau (1975) also examined low vowels, and found the same distinction

between [a] and [].3 Jacobsen (1978) recorded eight speakers of DhoLuo (Nilotic, Kenya) and
found that +ATR vowels have a higher tongue and wider pharyngeal cavity than -ATR vowels.

However, he found that speakers vary in terms of which articulatory parameter they employ to
achieve this, either tongue height or the tongue root position. There is no larynx displacement

distinction. This fits with similar results for Ateso (Lindau 1975), and Jacobsen (1978) suggests
that East African ATR systems may be different from West African ATR systems in this regard.

We employ the vowel transcriptions [i  e  u  o ] instead of the IPA symbols [i  i  e e u u o o] as the diacritics to
indicate ATR distinctions are difficult to discern.
Hess (1992) reports that Lindau (1975) examined the low vowel /a/ and its harmonic counterpart [ae], and determined that in the Akyem and Asante Twi dialects, [ae] does not have an advanced tongue root position. But this leaves
out the fact that the Akyem speaker also had [] in words preceding +ATR vowels. Lindau describes [] as +ATR
and [ae] as -ATR. She states (1975, p. 50) that `the [] is articulated with a more advanced tongue root and lower
larynx than [ae] and [a]. It is also interesting to note that the low [ae] has the highest larynx position of all eleven
vowels in Akyem." We examined the word list Lindau used (1978, p. 138) and found that while the [] preceded high
vowels, the [ae] was in the word sa [sae] `to dance,' which purportedly contrasts with sa [sa] `to cure.' However, these
actually have the same vowel but different tone: `to cure' is [sa]. This may explain the difference in larynx height.
Furthermore, the word `to dance' is shown with an optional glottal stop. Although glottal stops can occur pre-pausally
in Akan, perhaps the tokens this speaker produced did contain glottal stops, which could have affected the vowel
quality. It seems the [ae] for this one speaker are -ATR fronted allophones of /a/.

Tiede (1996) used MRI to map Akan vowels for one male speaker of the Asante Twi dialect.

He confirmed the tongue root advancement and lower larynx height for +ATR vowels of earlier

work, and also showed that +ATR vowels have a larger pharyngeal expansion. The -ATR vowels

showed pharyngeal constriction, not just a narrowing of the pharyngeal space due to tongue root
and larynx position. Ultrasound has also proven to be an effective imaging technique for ATR

contrasts. Studies on Kinande (Bantu, DR Congo) (Gick, Pulleyblank, Campbell, & Mutaka, 2006),
Dagbani (Gur, Ghana) (Hudu, 2010, 2014), Lopit (Nilotic, South Sudan) (Billington, 2014), Yoruba
(Benue-Congo, Nigeria) (Allen, Pulleyblank, & Ajiboye, 2013), and Akan (Kirkham & Nance, 2017)

confirm distinct tongue root positions for +ATR and -ATR vowels. Finally, Edmondson, Padayodi,
Hassan, and Esling (2007) used laryngoscopy to examine the production of Kabiye (Gur, Togo) and
Akan vowels. They determined that there is an "open epilaryngeal space, a less retracted tongue and

neutral larynx height" for [+constricted] (or +ATR vowels), whereas [-constricted] (-ATR vowels)
exhibit "a flatter forward-bending laryngeal sphincter angle, a more retracted tongue, and raised

laryngeal structures." Edmondson and Esling (2006) also report compression of the arytenoids and

aryepiglottic folds forwards and upwards for -ATR vowels. Most articulatory studies involve a small
number of speakers; the largest number is eight in Jacobsen's (1978) study of DhoLuo.

1.2 Acoustics
Numerous phonetic studies have attempted to determine the acoustic properties of ATR vowel
distinctions. Halle and Stevens (1969, p. 211) report that "The clearest and most consistent acoustic

consequence of widening the vocal tract in the vicinity of the tongue root is a lowering of the firstformant." This has been confirmed in numerous studies since. Lindau's (1978) examination of Akan
vowels reported that F1 is the main distinguishing acoustic parameter. [+ATR] vowels have lower

F1 than their [-ATR] counterparts. The F1/F2 vowel plot is shown below. The chart in Figure 2
shows that the +ATR vowels /i u e o/ are well-distinguished from the -ATR counterparts /  
 a/, but other vowels such as [e] and [] appear to be acoustically similar, though not identical.

Hess (1992) is a detailed study of the acoustic properties of Akan vowels, based on data from

a speaker of the Kwawu dialect (similar to Asante Twi). She examined four acoustic parameters:
Formant frequency, formant bandwidth, vowel duration, and relative amplitude of spectral
components. The two measures most strongly correlated with [ATR] were F1 and F1 bandwidth.
But since F1 is also a correlate of vowel height distinctions, she deemed F1 bandwidth as the

more reliable measurement for distinguishing ATR, at least for vowels that have similar formant

frequencies. [+ATR] vowels had narrower first formant bandwidths than [-ATR] vowels,

correlated with the third harmonic. [+ATR] vowels had a weaker third harmonic than [-ATR]
vowels. The F1 bandwidth distinction was useful for distinguishing [+ATR] [e, o] compared

to [-ATR] /, /, as their F1 values are similar, as seen on the following vowel plot in Figure 3.
This plot also includes the [ae], which is similar to [], but with higher F1.

Appiah-Padi (1994) analyzed data from nine male speakers of the Asante Twi dialect. She

found that besides [+ATR] vowels having lower F1 than [-ATR] vowels, [+ATR] vowels were

also longer, except for the []/[e] pair. Unlike Hess (1992), F1 bandwidth was not found to
distinguish ATR pairs of vowels. Furthermore, a discriminant analysis showed that all ATR pairs

were well distinguished using formants, bandwidth, duration, and amplitude, but, in contrast,
[]/[e] and [][o] showed much poorer discrimination ratios.

Kirkham and Nance (2017) provided the F1/F2 vowel space for six speakers of the Akuapem

dialect of Akan. They reported similar patterns to previous studies in terms of the similarity of []
and [e], as well as [] and [o]. They also showed that speakers differ in the position of the vowel
[]. For three male speakers, it is positioned close to [] or [], whereas for two female speakers,
it is close to [e]. For one female speaker, it is close to [a].

Other notable acoustic studies of ATR distinctions include Jacobson (1978) on Dholuo

(Nilotic, Kenya) and Guion, Post, and Payne (2004) on Maa (Nilotic, Kenya). Guion et al. found

that [+ATR] vowels have lower first formant values and relatively less energy in the higher
frequency regions than [-ATR] counterparts. Fulop, Kari, and Ladefoged (1998) analyzed data
from six speakers of Degema (Edoid, Nigeria). They found that all [+ATR]/[-ATR] vowel

pairs were distinguished by F1, except the low vowel pair. Starwalt (2008) investigated 11
African languages with ATR contrasts from the Kwa and Bantu families, with five speakers

of each language. She found considerable variation among languages and speakers, but the

most consistently reliable acoustic measurement distinguishing the contrast was F1. [+ATR]

vowels tended to have lower F1 than their [-ATR] pairs. F1 bandwidth and normalized A1-A2
measurements were only marginally different in some languages. [+ATR] vowels also tended to
have lower center of gravity measurements.

There are reports in the literature of `breathy' or `hollow' phonation associated with +ATR

vowels (Berry, 1957; Casali, 2008). Meanwhile -ATR vowels are described as `brighter' (Fulop et
al., 1998), `creaky,' or `tense' (see Denning, 1989 for an overview), but several acoustic studies

cast doubt on voice quality as a distinguishing feature. Hess (1992) finds no evidence for breathy

phonation in Akan as measured by the difference in amplitude between H2 and F0. Guion et al.
(2004) used electroglottographic data from one Maa speaker and found a slightly less constricted

glottis for [+ATR] than [-ATR] vowels, which may be indicative of a phonatory difference, but

they could find no discernible voice quality distinctions in recordings. Local and Lodge (2004)
found that for a speaker of the Tugen dialect of Kalenjin, breathiness was associated with -ATR

vowels, auditorily perceptible as well as established through measurements of contact quotient
of the glottal cycle made from electrolaryngographic recordings. They otherwise found that F1
was the primary acoustic measure distinguishing the vowels.

Finally, it is worth noting the acoustic similarity reported between certain vowels that are

distinguished by both ATR and height: []/[e] and []/[o]. Lindau (1987, p. 51) states that "...

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

there may be a case for concluding that for practical purposes, these two pairs of vowels have
merged phonetically in Akan." However, the tongue root positions are different, and the height

of the larynx is distinct between the +ATR and -ATR pairs, so articulatorily, they are produced
differently, despite being acoustically similar. Stewart (1971, p. 200) reports that in some Akan
dialects these vowels have merged, but it is not clear if that means an acoustic/perceptual merger

or a merger in articulation. Hess (1992) also noted an acoustic merging of front -ATR // and

front +ATR /e/, but states that "They remain phonetically distinct in that they are produced
in characteristic ways," so articulatorily they are different even if their acoustics makes them
similar or merged. Hess further reports they are distinguished by F1 bandwidth measurements.

Nevertheless, the acoustic similarity may have repercussions for their perception. Anecdotal
evidence points to perceptual difficulty. Casali (2017) reports that the high -ATR [] and mid

+ATR [e], as well as the [] and [o], are frequently confused by fieldworkers and this has

led to mischaracterizations of inventories. The term "fieldworkers" implies people who do not

speak languages with ATR contrasts. Therefore, they may be guided by their own first language
perceptual system, and this does not mean that speakers of languages with ATR contrasts cannot
distinguish them (Casali, 2017, p. 84). As for the [a]/[] pair, Casali (2012) reports that "The

difference between [a] and [ae] was also clearly perceptible to our Akuapem language consultant,
who described [ae] as sounding like the vowel []" (where the transcription [ae] corresponds to
[]). In the acoustic F1/F2 vowel space for many Akan speakers, [] is closer to [] than it is

to [a]. He does not report on the perception of the other similar vowels for this consultant.
Kpogo (2022) reports that there is an urban/rural distinction in the current Asante Twi dialect
with respect to the [+ATR] harmonic counterpart of /a/. While rural speakers have a distinct

tenth vowel ([ae] or []), urban speakers produce [e] instead, exhibiting merger with the [e]
corresponding to phonemic /e/. In addition to Akan, there are reports of acoustic similarity

between certain vowels in other ATR systems, particularly the high [-ATR] and mid [+ATR]

pairs [ e] and [ o] (e.g., Omamor, 1988 on Okp and Uvwi; Koffi, 2018 on Anyi; Casali, 2003,
2008 for general discussion). It should be noted that with the exception of Kpogo (2022), who

recorded data from 62 speakers, most acoustic studies are based on a small number of speakers,
often less than 10.

1.3 Perception
Despite the plethora of phonetic studies on articulation and acoustics in languages with ATR
harmony, there is very little research that examines perception, particularly perception by
speakers of ATR languages.

Lindau (1975) conducted a study of the perception of Akan vowels by four non-Akan speaking

phoneticians. Tokens of each vowel were produced by an Akyem dialect speaker (who apparently

had both -ATR [ae] and +ATR []) in a monosyllabic CV word in a carrier phrase and then the

7

8

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

vowel was repeated three times (e.g., mesee b   ). The task required the four listeners to
position a vowel produced in isolation on an F1/F2 chart. The composite results show that [o]

and [] were perceived as very similar but still distinct, but there was a perceptual merger for
[e] and [], and for [] and []. Still, Lindau notes that the native speaker who produced the

vowels was able to perceptually distinguish between [o] and [], and between [e] and [] on two
separate occasions, once after a three-week interval and once after a four-week interval.

Hess (1992) conducted a small perception study as part of her acoustic assessment of Akan

vowels. Specifically, she tested two Akan speakers on an identification task of single CV syllables
in isolation containing [] [e] [] [o]. It is not stated if the syllables were real words or not.

These vowels were chosen because each front or back pair are acoustically similar, especially
for F1, suggestive of a merger. Speakers were tested on 40 items, with 10 tokens of each vowel.
One speaker made two errors and the other speaker eight errors (87.5% accuracy), but it is not
reported on which vowels or what kinds of errors. Hess concluded that despite the acoustic
similarity of some of the vowels, they are perceptually distinct.

Fulop et al. (1998) report a perception study on Degema (Edoid, Nigeria) which has a 10

vowel ATR system (+ATR i e u o  and -ATR     a). Five Degema listeners performed a vowel

identification task on synthesized vowels that manipulated F1, F2, and F3 in order to test how
formants are used to distinguish vowels. Other elements such as fundamental frequency and

phonation type (relative formant amplitudes) were kept constant. Listeners were given a written
prompt of a particular vowel and asked to identify that vowel among a selection of tokens.

Results showed the -ATR mid vowels   as distinct from all other vowels, but considerable

overlap within three groups of vowels: [i ~  ~ e], [u ~  ~ o], and [a ~ ]; the study reports
that listeners "do not behave alike when trying to synthesize any of the other vowels" (p. 96).

Kingston, Macmillan, Walsh Dickey, Thorburn and Bartels (1997) also used synthesized

tokens designed to replicate variation in tongue root position and accompanying voice quality.
This was done by manipulating F1, and the percentage or quotient of the glottal cycle in which
the glottis was open and the overall tilt of the source spectrum. The experimental subjects were

American English listeners. They report that F1 integrates perceptually with spectral effects of
extreme lax or tense phonation.

A recent study (Ozburn, Giovio Canavesi, & Akinbo, 2022) examines perception of ATR

distinctions in Dagaare, a Mabia language of Ghana, and is the only other study besides the
current one to test perception with a large number of speakers (over 20) of a language with

ATR contrasts. Stimuli were kV and kVkV nonce words using front vowels [i  e ] in an ABX
task. Results showed low to medium rates of accuracy for three types of vowel contrasts (ATR

i ~ , e ~ , and ATR/height  ~ e), ranging from lowest performance with the  ~ e contrast
to highest with e ~  contrast. Disharmonic bisyllabic tokens resulted in lower accuracy rates

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

9

than monosyllables, but harmonic bisyllabic forms did not improve accuracy compared to
monosyllables.4

Thus, while a few studies have examined perception of ATR vowel qualities in listeners who

do not speak languages with ATR distinctions, or have examined synthetic vowel quality in

listeners who do, there are very few perceptual tests of natural speech of ATR vowel qualities
with listeners who speak languages with ATR distinctions. There are a few anecdotal reports that
certain vowel distinctions may pose difficulties. The current study aims to fill this gap.

1.4. Akan vowel system and ATR harmony
Akan is a central Tano language of the Kwa language family. It has several dialects including
Asante Twi, Akuapem, Akyem, and Fante. Specific descriptions of ATR vowel harmony in Akan

date back as early as Christaller (1875), taken up again in Berry (1957), Stewart (1967, 1971,

1983), Schachter and Fromkin (1968), Clements (1981, 1984), Dolphyne (1988), and Casali
(2012), among others. Recent papers by Akan-speaking linguists include Owusu (2014) and
Abakah (2016).

Berry (1957) divided the vowels into two sets and noted that prefixes alternate between

these sets according to the vowel of the root. Akan has nine phonemic vowels that contrast for

ATR. The low -ATR vowel /a/ is unpaired with a phonemic +ATR low vowel, but does have an
allophonic counterpart, transcribed as [] or [ae], and produced via vowel harmony.5

The Ozburn et al. (2022) study was conducted online in 2021, whereas the current study was run prior to the COVID19 pandemic in 2018 (Experiment 1) and early 2020 (Experiment 2), and was therefore able to be conducted in
person in Ghana.
Stewart claims that the a/ contrast is phonemic based on pairs such as ntam `oath' vs. ntm `between.' However,
ntm derives from nta `twin/pair' + mu `inside,' suggesting that the /u/ harmonized the /a/ and then was deleted,
leaving its low tone on the nasal. See also Appiah-Padi (1994) on this point. Even though Stewart acknowledges this
derivation, he still views the distinction as phonemic. Nevertheless, the view that these two vowels are phonemic is
a minority opinion. Kirkham and Nance (2017) state that they are phonemic in the Akuapem dialect based on earlier
reports (Ladefoged, 1968; Dolphyne, 1988), but those reports do not distinguish phonemic from allophonic status
clearly, indicating only the presence of [].

In addition, prefixes and vowel-initial suffixes harmonize with the root for ATR, and therefore
exhibit alternations between -ATR and +ATR:

`s/he bought it'

+ATR
c. wu-di  `you eat'
d. o-tu-i  `s/he dug it up'

Asymmetry in the system is noted by various authors. When /a/ precedes a +ATR vowel, it is

realized as +ATR [] (or [ae] depending on transcription): e.g., kri `weigh'. However, when

/a/ follows a +ATR vowel, it is realized as the -ATR [a]: bisa `ask' or eda `fire', which can
be construed as disharmonic forms. The vowel [] only occurs preceding a +ATR vowel and
never alone in a monosyllable. This asymmetry prompted Casali (2012) to argue that Akan
vowel harmony operates in a regressive direction. This argument is bolstered by two additional
properties. Consonant-initial -ATR suffixes do not harmonize with a +ATR root (4a,c) and

+ATR consonant-initial suffixes can trigger harmony leftwards, as shown by the agentive suffix
-ni (4d). See also Schacter and Fromkin (1968, p. 62) on this point.

Dolphyne (1988) treats [] as a [+ATR] allophonic variant of /a/. Clements (1981) argues that

it is actually gradient coarticulation that raises /a/ to [] due to a following high [+ATR] vowel,
but Hess (1992) and Casali (2012) dispute this analysis with acoustic evidence. Nevertheless, this

vowel does show different distribution and behavior from the phonemic vowels. Although /a/

can become [+ATR] [], the harmonized vowel fails to trigger [+ATR] harmony to its left: wobe-di `they will eat' vs. w-b-kri `they will weigh'. Therefore, in sequences of two /a/ preceding
a +ATR high vowel, only the first one undergoes harmony. There are also reports that while /a/
becomes [] before high vowels, it does not do so when in a prefix before mid vowels in verbs

(Stewart, 1967; Hess, 1992): wa-betu `he has come and pulled it out' vs. w-bisa `he has asked'. We
verified that this is the case with the Asante dialect. However, [] can occur before mid vowels in

nouns, eg., koo `parrot'. Finally, there are reports of some dialects having other restrictions on
mid +ATR vowels. Schacter and Fromkin (1968) report that Asante does not allow monosyllabic

verb roots with just [e] or [o], and where the other dialects have these vowels in verb roots, it has
[] and [].

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

1.5 Hypotheses on vowel perception in Akan
In order to test perception of ATR contrasts in Akan, we put forward two main hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Phonological contrast
Speakers of a language with ATR contrasts will have more difficulty distinguishing vowel
pairs that have an allophonic relationship than those that have a phonemic relationship.
Hypothesis 2: Acoustic similarity
Speakers of a language with ATR contrasts will have difficulty perceiving vowel pairs that are
acoustically similar, even if contrastive.

In general, phones that belong to separate phonemes are expected to be easier to distinguish

than allophones of the same phoneme. Boomershine, Hall, Hume, and Johnson (2008) tested
the perception of consonants that had either a phonemic or an allophonic relationship in English

and Spanish. English speakers were better at perceiving the distinction between d ~  in a

VCV context than Spanish speakers; this is a phonemic distinction in English but allophonic in
Spanish. Similarly, Spanish speakers were better at perceiving the distinction between d ~  in

a VCV context than English speakers, which is phonemic in Spanish but allophonic in English.

However, other researchers have found that the phonological environment influences perception.
Peperkamp, Pettinato, and Dupoux (2003) report that French speakers perform poorly at

distinguishing the allophones [] and [] of // preceding voiceless consonants. This is a context
in which the voiceless allophone [] is expected. However, they perform well at distinguishing

the same sounds in VC isolation contexts where the more widespread [] is expected. Overall,
the results of these two studies suggest that allophonic pairs should be perceived as more similar
to each other than phonemic pairs, but that context may impact the results if one allophone has

a more restricted distribution. Applying this to the Akan case, the Phonological contrast hypothesis
predicts that pairs that exhibit phonemic contrast for ATR are expected to be well distinguished.
This includes the high vowel pairs i ~  and u ~ , and the mid vowel pairs e ~ , o ~ . It

also includes the acoustically similar pairs  ~ e and  ~ o. Applying the general principle of

phonemic contrast, the low vowel pair  ~ a, where [] is allophonic and only occurs preceding
+ATR vowels, is expected to be poorly distinguished. However, given that [] is a contextual

+ATR vowel harmonic allophone of /a/, it is possible that better perception between [] and

[a] will occur in an isolation context where the default [a] is expected, following the results of
Peperkamp et al. (2003).

The Acoustic similarity hypothesis, in contrast, predicts that the main driving factor in

perceptual similarity will be acoustic similarity (Dubno & Levitt, 1981). That is, among

phonologically contrastive categories, there may be differences in acoustic similarity which

impact perception. This could also override allophonic relationships between segment pairs.

11

12

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

Furthermore, distribution and frequency in the lexicon can impact how segments in a phonemic

contrast relationship are perceived. Hall, Letawsky, Turner, Allen, and McMullin (2015) found

that phonemic fricatives in contexts where only one of the sounds is highly likely to occur are
perceived as more similar than the same sounds in contexts where either is likely to occur. With

respect to ATR, in some languages the high vowels are acoustically similar in the F1/F2 vowel
space (e.g., Ikposo (Starwalt, 2008), Masaai (Quinn-Wriedt, 2013), Lopit (Billington, 2017)). In

other languages, like Akan, they are more separated, and the mid +ATR vowels have lower F1
than the high [-ATR] vowels, what Casali (2012, p. 49) terms a `leapfrog' pattern or what can be

called a `flip' in the vowel space. Therefore, in terms of acoustic similarity, high ATR pairs may
not pose difficulty.

As reported above, however, certain vowels are very similar acoustically, even if distinguished

by phonological properties of ATR and vowel height: [] / [e] and [] / [o]. There are anecdotal
reports of fieldworkers having difficulty distinguishing these vowels (Casali, 2017), although
it is not well known if speakers of languages with ATR contrasts can distinguish among them,

except for the results of the Degema perceptual study (Fulop et al., 1998) and the Dagaare study
(Ozburn et al., 2022), and anecdotal reports in Omamor (1988) and Koffi (2018). Koffi (2018)

reports that Anyi speakers confused /e/ and // in literacy training. Omamor, a speaker of Uvwi,
notes that acoustic measurements helped reveal that Uvwi had the vowels // and //, which

were hard to distinguish from other vowels. Notwithstanding, speakers of an ATR language are

expected to perform better than speakers of a non-ATR language in detecting ATR contrasts
because they have acquired a language that employs these contrasts, and so we assume their

perceptual system is attuned to the perceptual cues of ATR contrasts. Although we do not directly
test the ATR vs. non-ATR language speaker hypothesis in the study, this is the reason speakers
of an ATR language were tested.

The acoustic similarity hypothesis would predict that the distinction between such vowels

would be hard to perceive, despite their phonological feature contrast. As for the vowel [],

its F1/F2 position suggests that it will be more likely to be confused with [] rather than [a]
based on acoustic similarity. This is so even if [] maps to the phoneme /a/ and /a/ and //

are differentiated by frontness and vowel height (in phonological features [low] and [back]). In
order to calculate acoustic similarity more precisely, we measured Euclidean distance of vowel

pairs using the F1/F2 measurements of vowel productions used in the stimuli in the experiments

(Table 1). Each formant was z-scored prior to calculation so that F2, with its higher raw Hz
values, did not dominate distances. The precise distances are provided in Appendix C, but the
results reveal three broad categories of distance, with vowel pairs distinguished by both ATR and

height features having the smallest distance. It is assumed that the smaller the Euclidean distance
measurement, the greater the similarity between vowels.

The Phonological contrast hypothesis does not predict a difference in perception based on the

number of phonological features that two vowels may share or not share. Nevertheless, it is

instructive to examine how phonological similarity calculations differ from acoustic similarity.
Frisch, Broe and Pierrehumbert (2004) propose a phonological similarity metric using a formula

based on distinctive phonological features and shared and unshared natural classes. Similarity =

shared natural classes / shared natural classes +unshared natural classes. Using this method, the
lower the number, the less phonologically similar the vowels are. The least phonologically similar
phonemic vowels are the ATR+Height vowels  ~ e and  ~ o, while the other vowels have

higher similarity (Table 2). See Appendix D for details. Note that because this metric of similarity
is based on distinctive phonological features, only phonemes are included for assessment.

These two measures of similarity produce contradictory results for the ATR+Height vowels

compared to the other vowels. The ATR+Height vowels have high acoustic similarity (that is, low

Euclidean distance), but low phonological similarity. Acoustic similarity measurements suggest
that distinguishing ATR+Height vowels will pose perception difficulties, while phonological
similarity suggests they should be well-differentiated.

The predictions of the two hypotheses with respect to ATR differences are presented below

(Table 3) with respect to predicted performance on a perceptual discrimination task. Both hypotheses
predict that the non-low ATR vowels will show good discrimination in Akan, based on phonological

contrast or the separation in acoustic space. The two hypotheses differ with respect to the other
vowel pairs. The Phonological hypothesis predicts that those pairs distinguished by both ATR and
vowel height will be easily discriminated, but the Acoustic similarity hypothesis predicts difficulty.

The opposite predictions are made for the low ATR pair. As the relationship is allophonic, perceptual

difficulty is predicted under the Phonological hypothesis, whereas the Acoustic hypothesis predicts
that, as they are not phonetically similar, good discrimination should result.

2. Experiment 1
2. 1 Methods

2.1.1 Participants
Forty-one Akan speakers participated in the experiment (26 M, 15 F) in September 2018 in
Ghana. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 28 years old. All subjects were recruited at the

University of Education, Winneba, Ghana. Thirty of the speakers spoke the Asante Twi dialect,
five spoke both Twi and Fante, three spoke Twi and Sefwi, one spoke Twi and Nafara, one

spoke Fante, and one spoke Akuapem as well as the Mabia language Frafra. The participants
were compensated at a rate consistent with local norms for study participation (5$). Written

instructions were presented in Akan and the researcher (Michael Obiri-Yeboah) spoke in Akan

to the participants. Each participant completed a questionnaire on their language background
and they also completed a separate music perception experiment (20 of the subjects preceding
the vowel perception experiment and 21 subjects following the vowel perception experiment).

2.1.2 Stimuli
Stimuli were audio recordings of CV monosyllables. Monosyllables were chosen to avoid the
influence of vowel harmony and to allow the testing of perception in isolation. One hundred

twenty-four test trials and 54 filler trials were used in the experiment. All trials consisted of two
consonant-vowel (CV) low-toned syllables. Sixty `same' trials consisted of a test syllable paired

with another production of the same syllable, e.g., ka ~ ka, where each syllable was recorded
separately. Thirty syllables had the onset /k/ combined with all 10 vowels, so that there were

three tokens of each CV combination. Three different tokens were used so that no `same' pair
contained the same two tokens (e.g., ka1 ~ ka2, ka2 ~ ka3, ka3 ~ ka1). Another 30 syllables

had the onset /s/ combined with all 10 vowels, with three repetitions of each combination. C
syllables were extracted from bisyllabic CCV words and the duration normalized to approach

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

15

duration of other vowels. This was done as [] only occurs preceding +ATR vowels, and the
speaker was not able to produce this vowel in CV in isolation.

Sixty-four `different' trials consisted of low-toned CV syllables with either [k] (32) or [s] (32)

onsets. These syllables combined different vowels counterbalanced in both orders with the same
onset (e.g., ki ~ ke and ke ~ ki). Each vowel pair occurred in four trials, with both onsets and both

orders. Vowel combinations were divided into four classes: 1) Point vowels, 2) ATR contrasts,

3) Height contrasts, and 4) ATR+Height contrasts as in Table 4. Point vowels were selected to

be maximally distinct and serve as a confirmation of general task understanding. These are the
vowels most dispersed in the acoustic vowel space (highest and lowest F1/F2).6 Height contrasts
were selected as a counterpoint to ATR. They also differ on one phonological feature and are
distinguished primarily by F1. Finally, those vowels which differed on both ATR and Height were

vowels that are the most acoustically similar. Rounding and back features were kept constant for
these contrasts, although [] is [+front, -back] and [] is central or [-front, -back].

Table 4: `different' vowel combinations.
Fifty-four Filler items consisted of CV syllables with one of 10 onsets drawn from /f b m t d t

s k kp h/ and one of 10 vowels. All these onsets except [kp] occur in Akan, but [kp] is common

in other Ghanaian languages. There were 28 same items consisting of two different tokens, and
26 different items, 20 with the same vowel but a different consonant, and six with a different
vowel and a different consonant. Fillers were included to provide variety and to disguise the
experimental manipulation, so they were not analyzed.

Stimuli were recorded by a multilingual speaker (Michael Obiri-Yeboah) of Gua (Kwa, Ghana)

and Akan (Akuapem dialect), pronouncing the tokens as if speaking Gua. The Gua vowel system

is very similar to that of Akan. It has the same nine contrastive vowels and a tenth allophonic
vowel that is also the [+ATR] counterpart of /a/. It has +ATR dominant regressive harmony
like Akan (Casali, 2012; Obiri-Yeboah, 2021). We reasoned that a perceptual task using Akan

monosyllables would be too easy, such that participants would perform well on most vowel

pairs. By using a language with a vowel system very close to Akan's, we expected participants

to perceptually map their Akan vowel system onto the Gua vowels they heard, as per second
language models of vowel perception, such as the Perceptual Assimilation Model (Best, 1995;

Tyler et al., 2014) or the L2 Linguistic Perception Model (L2LP) (Escudero, 2009). Gua high
-ATR and mid +ATR vowels are acoustically similar and are `flipped' in acoustic space, as

in Akan. Ultrasound images from the same speaker of Gua shows tongue root advancement/

retraction (Myers et al., to appear). We measured the F1/F2 properties of the vowel tokens used
in the study (both fillers and test items), as shown in Figure 4; mean values are indicated by the

position of the vowel label. These results are similar to those reported for Akan, although [u]
is pronounced with higher F2 following coronal consonants [s] and [t] than following [k] (the
three points further back).

2.1.3 Procedure
An auditory AX discrimination task (same/different) was presented to participants using
PsychoPy on a laptop through headphones. The interstimulus interval (ISI) was set at 500 ms.

The duration of the ISI can affect processing (Babel & Johnson, 2010; Pisoni, 1973, 1975; Werker
& Logan, 1985, among others). Short ISIs are thought to encourage acoustic processing whereas

longer ISIs are thought to favor phonological or lexical processing (Piccinini & Arvaniti, 2019).

Babel and Johnson (2010) determined that ISIs 500 ms or above are sufficient for phonological
processing. We, therefore, selected an ISI that could encourage phonological processing, but was

still short enough that acoustic processing might also result, so as not to bias processing towards
a particular hypothesis. Selecting an ISI that was too short would favor acoustic processing, while

choosing one that was too long would favor phonological processing. Participants were told that
they would hear words from another language and would be asked if the two words sounded

the same or different. They pressed button `a' on the keyboard for same (adekor in Akan) or `s'
for different (soronko in Akan). Items were presented in random order to the participants. There

was a short practice trial (with no feedback) to habituate participants to the experiment. The
experiment took 15-25 minutes to complete.

2.2 Results
One participant was removed from the results, as they consistently showed poor performance
across all items (5.2 SD below mean accuracy). The results of the remaining 40 participants are
shown below. Figure 5 shows the results of the `different' test items, with proportion "different"
responses (hits) along the y-axis. Responses to all the items are included in Appendix A.

Figure 5 suggests that point vowels were well discriminated, as were all ATR pairs, including

the allophonic +ATR [] and its -ATR counterpart [a]. Height pairs were also well discriminated,
but with slightly lower rates for the round vowels. However, the ATR+Height combination pairs

were poorly discriminated, with responses of "different" that were not far above the false-alarm
baseline.

For purposes of analysis, data were converted to d' scores (Figure 6) by subtracting z-scored

false alarms from z-scored hits for a particular vowel pair. We used all "same" trials to create the

false alarm baseline. To correct for values of 1 and 0, which yield z-values of infinity, we added
or subtracted 1/60/2 = 1/120--half of an item in the condition with the most items, the "same"

condition. These d' scores were then subjected to a within-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with Vowel Type (point vowels; ATR-differing; height-differing; both-differing) as the predictor.
Analyses were conducted in R (R Core Team, 2020).

The effect of Vowel Type reached significance (F(3,117) = 297.7, p < .0001). To assess the

meaning of this result, we compared all vowel types to each other with Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons. Bonferroni correction sets the criterial p-value at .0083 for six comparisons.

Figure 5: Experiment 1, proportion hits to all tested vowel contrasts, with standard errors.
Dashed line represents the false-alarm baseline, that is, how often listeners responded "different"
when the two vowels heard were actually the same vowel. Most figures were constructed using
the ggplot2 library (Wickham, 2016) in R (R Core Team, 2020).

Figure 6: Experiment 1, d' scores for each vowel contrast type with standard errors.
Point vowels were marginally better discriminated than ATR vowels (t(39) = 2.62, p = .01;
marginally significant after Bonferroni correction) and significantly better discriminated than
Height vowels (t(39) = 5.76, p < .0001). Height vowels were discriminated significantly worse
than ATR vowels (t(39) = 3.26, p = .002), and the ATR+Height combination showed weaker

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

performance than all other conditions (t(39)  19.16, p < .0001). Nonetheless, all conditions,
including the ATR+Height combination, exceeded chance performance (chance meaning that
hits = FAs, for a d' = 0; t(39)  7.57, p < .0001).

To better understand the source of the outcome, we examined hit rate differences amongst

individual pairs. The rate for all three of the ATR+Height pairs fell well below the other conditions,
and indeed none of the 40 participants achieved 100% detection. The highest accuracy in the

ATR+Height condition was by a single participant who scored 58% on "different" trials. In fact, two
participants detected none of the ATR+Height differences, even though they performed very well

on the other pairs in the experiment. Yet the a ~ [] pair, despite being an allophonic distinction,
was very well discriminated, with 95.6% of changes detected (SD = 9.6%; 33/40 participants, or

83%, detected differences on all four trials with this contrast). A follow-up test on d' values for

individual vowels revealed that the allophonic a ~ [] pair was as well-discriminated as the other,
phonemic ATR pairs considered together (t(39) = 1.73, p = .09), with a d' value of 3.59 (SD = .816),
numerically higher than the d' of the other four ATR pairs (d' = 3.39, SD = .730).

Finally, to provide further support for the Acoustic Hypothesis, we conducted a significance

test of the correlation between the Euclidean distances between vowel pairs and accuracy on
different trials. There was a significant positive linear relationship between the two measures
(t(11) = 4.12, r = .779, p = .002), as shown in Figure 7.

2.3 Discussion
The results were not consistent with the Phonological contrast hypothesis (Table 5). Indeed,
participants performed poorly on three phonological contrasts that were acoustically similar.
In contrast, participants were able to distinguish ATR pairs with ease, whether they were the
non-low phonemic pairs or the low pair that constituted a single phoneme. The pairs with which

participants had difficulty were precisely those predicted by the Acoustic similarity hypothesis.

Moreover, the fact that the pair e ~  exhibits the numerically poorest discrimination is congruent
with earlier reports (Lindau, 1975; Hess, 1992) that this vowel pair is merging acoustically in
Akan, while the round vowel pair [o ~ ] is less similar.

Table 5. Experiment 1 predictions compared to results.
The result for the low ATR allophonic pair was in line with Peperkamp et al. (2003), who

found that allophonic fricatives in French are perceived well in isolation contexts. We suspect that
[] is likely being perceptually `matched' to //, as they are highly similar. If [] is perceptually

`matched' to //, this explains why the a ~  pair is easy to distinguish, as the a ~  pair had a
very high accuracy rate. The strong performance on the non-low ATR pairs is in line with both
hypotheses. Unlike some other ATR languages, high vowels in Gua and Akan have relatively
large F1 differences, due to the `flip' in vowel space of high -ATR and mid +ATR vowels. This
acoustic separation leads to better perception.

The fact that acoustic similarity drives the perception over phonological contrast could be

due to several factors. One possibility is the nature of the task itself. The AX task may be more
suited to acoustic perception than phonological discrimination. Subjects are simply asked if two
tokens are the same or different with little contextual information. Relatedly, the interstimulus

interval of 500 ms may not have been long enough to favor phonological processing. Although

we did not want to bias the result one way or another, a longer ISI might have facilitated
phonological processing. A second issue with the task is that participants were told the words

were from another language, so this might have discouraged Akan phonological processing, even

if the tokens sounded like Akan vowels. As the words were in fact from another (albeit closelyrelated) language, Akan speakers might have been at a disadvantage at distinguishing between
highly similar vowels if they had slightly different pronunciations.

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

A third possibility is that orthographic similarity influenced responses to auditory stimuli.

Modern Akan orthography uses seven vowels instead of nine. Precisely, the phonemic vowels

that are hard to distinguish are written with a single character. Both  and e are written `e' and 
and o are written `o'. Historically, the Gold Coast orthography distinguished these similar vowels

with diacritics so that  () contrasted with o and  () with e. However, the Standardized Akan

orthography, intended to bridge dialects, no longer uses diacritics (Akan Language Committee,
1995). It is possible that the absence of visual differentiation between these vowels leads literate

Akan listeners to conflate them auditorily. Of course, this is a chicken-and-egg problem, in that
it is not clear whether this orthographic change led to the perceptual difficulties or whether the

vowels were already perceived to have merged or be similar. Yet, allophonic [] and [a] are both
written as `a', and this pair was successfully discriminated, so orthographic influence cannot be
the whole story.

A fourth possible explanation for the acoustically-driven outcome is that it is shaped by the

frequency and distribution of the vowels. First, vowel harmony in polysyllabic words ensures that
o and , or e and  generally do not cooccur within the same word. So, distinguishing between

them may not be required that often if the presence of other vowels that are more easily discerned
in the word signifies the -ATR or +ATR status of other vowels in the word.7 The AX task with

monosyllables may have been difficult precisely because there were no other contextual clues on
which to rely. As previously noted, /e/ and /o/ are reported to be rare in monosyllables. Berry

(1957, p. 125) states they are rare in CV monosyllables in the Akuapem dialect and of doubtful

occurrence in Asante. Dolphyne (1988, p. 98) also reports this for Akuapem and some subdialects
of Fante, and notes that /o/ occurs in a few words only in Asante. Most of the participants in

our study were Asante speakers. Although it is generally assumed that Proto-Kwa had a nine-

vowel system (Williamson, 1973), Abakah (2016) suggests that /e o/ arose historically via
vowel harmony from a seven-vowel system. If this is correct, it would explain their more limited

distribution. This does not necessarily mean that these vowels are not phonemic, however.
Although rare in monosyllables, they do occur in some verb stems in some dialects (e.g., sje `say'

de `receive'), and they do appear word-finally in polysyllabic nouns (e.g., brobe `taro', dede
`noise', mko `pepper' or buro `maize'. As vowel harmony is regressive (Casali, 2012), /e o/ do

appear to be phonemic. Nevertheless, it is possible that predictability of distribution could hinder
perception in monosyllabic CV context even with phonemes if [-ATR]   a are expected over

the less common [+ATR] e o . This is in line with Hall et al. (2015), who found that phonemic
fricatives in more predictable contexts in English are perceived as more similar than the same
sounds in less predictable contexts.

7

Akan does have cross-word vowel harmony (Schachter, 1989; Dolphyne, 1988; Hess, 1992; Kugler, 2015) that applies
regressively and affects the last vowel of the preceding word, so disharmonic words can arise in sentential contexts
due to this process.

21

22

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

To address several of these issues, we designed a second experiment. In order to address the

concern that monosyllabic contexts may not be as representative, the second experiment tested

bisyllables. Bisyllables also provide the opportunity to test out disharmonic sequences to assess
whether disharmonic sequences are more difficult to distinguish than harmonic sequences. To
encourage phonological processing, the second experiment was an ABX task, where listeners
were asked to determine whether nonce word X better matched nonce word A or nonce word B.

To best assess listeners' Akan spoken language knowledge, the vowels were recorded as nonce
words in Akan, and listeners were told that these were to be construed as Akan words, ruling out
language mismatch as an explanation for the results of Experiment 1.

3. Experiment 2
3. 1 Methods

3.1.1 Participants
Forty-one Akan speakers participated in the experiment (21 M, 20 F) in February and March,
2020, in Ghana. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 36. All subjects were recruited at the

University of Education, Winneba, Ghana, but none were the same as those in the first experiment.

Thirty-five of the speakers spoke the Asante Twi dialect, one spoke Akuapem, one spoke Akyem,
one spoke Kwahu, and three were bidialectal (Asante/Akyem (two) or Asante/Akuapem (one)).

The participants were compensated (5$). Written instructions were presented in Akan and the
researcher (Michael Obiri-Yeboah) spoke in Akan to the participants. Each participant completed

a questionnaire on their language background and they also completed a separate music
perception experiment (20 of the subjects preceding the vowel perception experiment, and 21
subjects following the vowel perception experiment).

3.1.2 Stimuli
Experiment 2 consisted of 272 trials. Each trial consisted of three words, two of which were
different tokens of the same word, whereas the other contained vowels that mismatched along

one or more dimensions. Two consonant frames were used - gVbV and tVkV - and all tokens had

low tone. These frames did not correspond to any actual Akan words, as verified by two Akan
speakers. In order to include [] in the tokens, this vowel was produced preceding the vowel [i]

in tokens such as [tki] or [kti], and then the syllable in which it appeared was spliced with
another syllable. No other tokens were spliced in order to keep the tokens sounding as natural
as possible.

Set A consisted of 96 trials where each token presented contained two identical vowels, e.g.,

A. gubu B. gb X. gubu. The vowel pairs compared were the same as used in Experiment 1,

encompassing ATR, Height, and ATR+Height differences, except point vowels were not used,
and we dropped the [] ~ [a] height combination to reduce the number of trials. There were

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

23

eight trials per combination so that the order of A and B were switched and X was matched to
either A or B, and both consonant frames were employed. All of the bisyllables in these trials
were necessarily harmonic given that the vowels in each word are identical.

Set B consisted of 64 harmonic non-identical vowel trials, where harmonic means that within

a word, the vowels agreed for ATR, and non-identical means that within a word, the two vowels
were not identical. These consisted of trials where either A or B had non-identical vowels, the other

word had identical vowels and the X always had identical vowels (e.g., A. gubu B. gubo X. gubu or
gobo). This meant that there was only one vowel across all three words that was different. The trials

contained words in which both orders internal to the word (gubo and gobu) were used, and they
also varied whether the non-identical word was A or B, resulting in eight combinations. Adding in
the two different consonant frames, there were 16 trials per pair. The harmonic restriction meant
that only height differences were employed in these trials: i ~ e u ~ o  ~   ~ .

Set C consisted of 112 disharmonic non-identical vowels. They followed the same format as Set

B, except that the vowels within the word mismatched for ATR, and either had identical height

(e.g., A. gbu B. gubu X. gubu), or mismatched for both ATR and height (e.g., A. gbo B. gobo
X. gobo). We did not test the [] ~ [] distinction in this set to reduce the number of trials, due

to concern over the length of the experiment. Note that disharmonic within a word does not
necessarily mean phonotactically illegal in Akan. As harmony is regressive and +ATR dominant,
sequences of -ATR+ATR are phonotactically illegal within a word, but the reverse sequence of

+ATR -ATR is disharmonic but phonotactically legal, as in the examples in (4). Not all vowel
combinations occur in this order though. The stimuli are summarized in Table 6:

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

Stimuli were recorded by a multilingual speaker (Michael Obiri-Yeboah) of Gua (Kwa, Ghana)

and Akan (Akuapem dialect), pronouncing the tokens as if speaking Akan. This change in the
language of the stimuli from Experiment 1 ensured that the subjects knew they were processing

Akan. Results should therefore reflect Akan L1 processing and not processing of an unfamiliar
language with a similar vowel system. The acoustic F1/F2 vowel space of the tokens is provided
below in Figure 8, measured from both syllables of the identical vowel tokens in the experiment.

As expected, there is overlap between [] and [e], and between [] and []. There is very little
overlap between [] and [o]. This is in line with other reports that the acoustically similar front
vowels are closer than the back ones in Akan.

3.1.3 Procedure
An auditory ABX discrimination task was presented to participants using PsychoPy on a laptop

through headphones. The interstimulus interval (ISI) was set at 700 ms between the first and
second and between the second and third stimuli. This longer ISI was aimed to encourage

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

phonological processing (Piccinini & Arvaniti, 2019). Participants were told that they would hear

new, made-up words in Akan. They were asked if the last word sounded the same as the first or
the second. They pressed button `b' on the keyboard for `first' (baako in Akan) or `m' for `second'
(mmienu in Akan). Items were presented in random order to the participants. There was a set of

four practice trials, half answer `first' and half answer `second', using distinctly-different words

(i.e., teke-gubu-teke) and providing accuracy feedback to acclimate participants to the procedure.
If participants missed one of these four easy items, the practice trials were repeated. After one

repetition of the practice trials, participants continued to the main experiment regardless of score.

3.2 Predictions
Based on the results of Experiment 1, we make several predictions for the results of Experiment 2

in accordance with the Acoustic Hypothesis (Table 7). With respect to the identical vowel pairs

(Set A), we expect to see excellent discrimination for ATR contrasts and for Height contrasts,
but poor performance for vowels contrasting in both ATR and Height. Given the outcome of
Experiment 1, we also expect that ATR pairs will be discriminated slightly better than Height

pairs. Compared to Experiment 1, the bisyllables may also afford speakers more opportunity
to detect distinctions, since there is not reliance on a single vowel, possibly leading to high
accuracy.

As for the non-identical vowel tokens (Sets B and C), we expect an overall poorer

discrimination rate for these sets than identical (Set A), as there are two opportunities to hear
the vowel distinctions (gibi vs. gebe) with identical vowels, but only one opportunity with the

non-identical categories (gibi vs. gibe). At a more detailed level, the role of vowel harmony

should impact the results. The Harmony hypothesis (Table 8) predicts that Set B, where all

vowels match for ATR and are harmonic, should show better discrimination than disharmonic
forms (that is, Set C).

3.3 Results
As with Experiment 1, the acoustically similar pairs had lower rates of accurate perception

compared to the ATR pairs and the Height pairs (Figure 9). Detection rates for ATR pairs and

Height pairs in the Identical stimuli (Set A) were high. For completeness, accuracy for individual
sound pairs are shown in Appendix B.

For maximum parallelism to Experiment 1, we computed d' for this experiment as well. The

d' values for ABX tasks are computed slightly differently, as follows. Correct trials where the

expected response was the A (first) item were counted as hits, while correct trials where the
expected response was the B (second) item were counted as correct rejections. Correct rejections
were converted to false alarms (FA = 1-CR) and then hits and FAs were used to compute d'.

Figure 9: Experiment 2 accuracy values, with standard errors. Dashed line indicates chance
performance (.50). Identical-vowel trials (e.g., gubu-gb-gubu) showed high accuracy for
ATR+Height contrasts, with lower overall accuracy for ATR+Height-differing items. Nonidentical vowels (e.g., gubu-gub-gubu; Sets B and C) showed similar patterns, again with Height
(harmonic) and ATR (disharmonic) accuracy higher than ATR+Height (disharmonic).
We conducted an ANOVA on d' values with two within-subjects predictors: Vowel Identity

within the differing word (identical vowels, nonidentical vowels) and vowel Contrast Type (ATR,
Height, or ATR+Height). Trials with - were dropped as these did not have a counterpart in the
differing-vowel case. Recall that Bonferroni correction for three comparisons yields a p-value of

.0083. There was an effect of Contrast Type (F(2,76) = 102.9, p < .0001), such that ATR pairs

showed marginally higher d' than Height pairs (t(38) = 2.72, p = .01; marginal after Bonferroni

correction), and both exceeded the ATR+Height pairs (vs. ATR: t(38) = 11.58, p < .0001;
vs. Height: t(38) = 10.08, p < .0001). There was also an effect of Vowel Identity (F(1,38) =

84.7, p < .0001), such that d' values were greater when the test word contained two identical
vowels than when the test word contained two different vowels. Finally, the main effects were

qualified by a two-way interaction (F(2,76) = 15.04, p < .0001). To understand the nature of

the interaction, we compared the contrast types for each Vowel Identity. For identical vowels,
ATR changes were better identified than Height changes (t(38) = 3.16, p = .003), and both were

better identified than ATR+Height changes; (vs. Height: t(38) = 8.82, p < .0001; vs. ATR: t(38)
= 10.81, p < .0001). The results for nonidentical vowels inform the Harmony Hypothesis, that
harmonic nonidentical vowel stimuli would be easier to process than disharmonic stimuli. While

both Height-changing stimuli (e.g., gubo; t(38) = 8.64, p < .0001) and ATR-changing stimuli
(e.g., gub; t(38) = 8.88, p < .0001) were better identified than ATR+Height-changing stimuli

(e.g., gbo), the Height stimuli were no better detected than the (disharmonic) ATR stimuli

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

(t(38) = 0.06, p = .95). While this might seem to suggest that disharmonic stimuli are not
overall at a perceptual disadvantage, it is worth noting that the disharmonic ATR stimuli show
a larger drop from the identical-vowel stimuli than the Height stimuli do. A follow-up ANOVA
compared the size of this drop by testing the interaction of Contrast Type (ATR, Height; leaving

out ATR+Height) and Vowel Identity. The interaction term was significant (F(1,38) = 6.82, p

= .01), suggesting that the drop in performance in two-vowel stimuli was larger for ATR stimuli
than for Height stimuli, which is consistent with a relative disadvantage of disharmony.8 This
may be seen as partly consistent with the Harmony Hypothesis. Despite all of these differences,

and low d' values in some cases, all six values shown in Figure 10 exceeded chance (t(38)  4.28,
p  .0001), meaning that all vowel classes show better discriminability than chance.

Figure 10: d' values for identical-vowel and non-identical vowel trials, collapsed across vowel
pairs. The - trials have been omitted as they were only present in the identical-vowel condition.
As in Experiment 1, we continue to find that ATR+Height-differing vowels are difficult to

distinguish perceptually. Among the ATR+Height contrasts, - appeared to be distinguished
more accurately. To verify this statistically, we computed individual per-vowel d' scores for

identical-vowel ATR+Height stimuli. The - contrast outperformed the other two ATR+Height
8

A reviewer asks if there are differences in performance on the disharmonic sequences depending on the order of the
vowels, due to the regressive nature of vowel harmony. Poorer perception might be expected if the vowel order is -
ATR +ATR (illicit) compared to +ATR -ATR (licit). This is indeed the case if the standard X is +ATR+ATR, but not
when it is -ATR -ATR, suggesting that speakers may be perceptually compensating for regressive harmony. However,
the order +ATR -ATR was harder to differentiate when X was -ATR -ATR than when it was +ATR +ATR, which
does not appear to be due to directionality. We do not include directionality results for reasons of space, and due to
the difficulty of making clear hypotheses and predictions. For example, if participants misperceive [] as [e] and []
as [o], or vice versa, there are a range of possible perceptual directionality outcomes.

contrasts (F(2,76) = 19.01, p < .0001; individually, it outscored e-, t(38) = 5.26, p < .0001;
and o-, t(38) = 5.50, p < .0001).9

As in Experiment 1, to provide further support for the Acoustic Hypothesis, we assessed the

significance of the correlation between the vowel pairs' Euclidean distances and their accuracy
(identical trials only). As in Experiment 1, there was a positive linear relationship between the
two measures (t(10) = 3.60, r = .751, p = .005), as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11: Experiment 2, accuracy x acoustic Euclidean distance scores.
As in Experiment 1, we wanted to know how well the only allophonic ATR contrast, []-a,

fared. Did it show poor discrimination (in keeping with the Phonological hypothesis) or good

discrimination (in keeping with the Acoustic hypothesis)? To test this, we computed per-vowel d'
9

While accuracy values appear different for ATR+Height between the two studies, this is primarily because Experiment 1 just shows accuracy on the "different" trials, while Experiment 2 shows accuracy on all trials. The d' values
for the two studies are similar. While d' values are somewhat lower for Height-only and ATR-only in Experiment 2,
given the higher memory load in Experiment 2 (having to remember four syllables before getting to X (A+B = 4
syllables), over a longer ISI, vs. Experiment 1's one syllable and shorter ISI), as well as the change in language, we
are reluctant to ascribe too much practical significance to this difference.

scores for identical-vowel stimuli differing in ATR. A t-test comparing the []-a pair (d' = 3.85,

SE = 1.38) to the combination of the other four pairs (d' = 2.73, SE = 1.07) showed that []-a
had greater d' (t(38) = 4.95, p < .0001), suggesting that its allophonic status did not make it

more difficult to discriminate. This is consistent with the Acoustic hypothesis--and our findings
in Experiment 1--but not the Phonological hypothesis.

3.4 Discussion
As with Experiment 1, the acoustically similar phonemic pairs  ~ e and  ~ o had lower rates

of accurate perception compared to ATR and Height pairs. This was true for both Identical
and Non-identical vowel trials. Further, the [] ~ a ATR pair was again perceived well, even

though this is an allophonic contrast. Like Experiment 1, these results are consistent with the
Acoustic hypothesis whereby similar acoustic vowels exhibit lower perceptual accuracy. This

is especially striking for the [o] ~ [] contrast, as these vowels are acoustically similar but do

not show as great an overlap in the acoustic vowel space. This is the case even if the vowels
are produced in a different articulatory manner and even if they are distinguished by two
phonological features. While degree of phonological similarity was not part of the hypotheses

30

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

tested, being distinguished by two phonological features contributes to a low phonological

similarity rating, which is not congruent with the perceptual results for  ~ e and  ~ o pairs.
As for the Harmony hypothesis, it was not the case that bisyllabic harmonic Height tokens were

better perceived than bisyllabic disharmonic ATR tokens, as predicted. Performance on the
non-identical tokens were similar for all ATR pairs and Height pairs, but the ATR+Height pairs

again showed the weakest performance. However, there was a stronger drop in performance
for the ATR pairs than the Height pairs, suggesting that disharmony did negatively impact
perception for ATR distinctions.

However, unlike in Experiment 1, the  ~  pair showed much better perceptual accuracy

than the other ATR+Height pairs in Experiment 2. We do not believe this is due to the vowels
being significantly different between the two experiments, as they were pronounced similarly in

both with a large overlap in F1/F2. This difference may be due to two aspects of Experiment 2.

First, [] does not occur in monosyllables in Akan words, but [] can occur in initial position in

bisyllables (albeit followed by +ATR vowels other than []), so the bisyllabic environment aids
perception. However, it is also possible that the spliced bisyllabic gb/tk tokens may not have

sounded as natural as other tokens, so when gb was compared to gb, it may have been easier
to detect different vowels. In Experiment 1, we cut out the first syllable [k] from a bisyllabic

word, but in this experiment, we had to splice two halves of two words together. Regardless, it
is clear that overall, the ATR+Height pairs are more difficult to perceive than ATR differences
or Height differences.

4. General Discussion
Overall, both experiments provided evidence inconsistent with the Phonological hypothesis

and consistent with the Acoustic hypothesis. Both confirmed that the acoustically similar

vowels [] / [e] and [] / [o] are poorly discriminated by Akan listeners, even if they are
differentiated by two distinctive phonological features. Conversely, both experiments also
confirmed that the acoustically distinct vowels [] / [a] are well discriminated, despite being
in an allophonic rather than contrastive relationship.

Recall that there were several differences between the two experiments, which make their

relative agreement all the more striking. They varied in number of syllables, monosyllabic
(Experiment 1) vs. bisyllabic (Experiment 2); interstimulus interval, with 500 ms (Experiment 1),
vs. a more "phonological" 700 ms in Experiment 2; words in the phonologically-similar language

Gua in Experiment 1, vs. nonce words in Akan in Experiment 2; an AX design that allowed acoustic
discrimination in Experiment 1 vs. an ABX design that required a more phonological level of

comparison in Experiment 2. Despite these differences, acoustically similar (but phonologically
distinct) pairs in both experiments were significantly harder to distinguish than the other pairs,

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

and the allophonic (but acoustically distinct) pair were at least as easy to distinguish as the
phonemic counterparts.

The Ozburn et al. (2022) study on Dagaare also found that the ATR+Height pair [ ~ e] was

poorly discriminated, at least compared to [e ~ ], in keeping with the overlap in the acoustic
space of that pair, and similar to our results. However, discrimination was not significantly

different for [i ~] compared to either of the other two pairs. They also found that Dagaare
listeners fared worse with bisyllable disharmonic stimuli than with monosyllables, but did not

find that harmonic stimuli improved perception compared to monosyllables. The experiments
employed an ABX design and had monosyllable and bisyllable stimuli in the same experiment,
allowing for direct comparison between the two kinds of stimuli. Our Experiment 2 results did

show lower accuracy for disharmonic bisyllables than harmonic identical forms, but not for
harmonic non-identical forms. However, we are not able to make the same comparison between
monosyllables and bisyllables due to the multiple different parameters outlined above.

5. Implications for the phonology of Akan
Akan appears to present a case of near-merger - the situation whereby speakers differentiate

sounds in production, but report that they are `the same' in perception tests (Labov et al.,
1991). Indeed, phoneticians in earlier work often described the situation in Akan as a merger,

particularly for the vowels [] ~ [e] due to the close F1/F2 acoustic measurements. However,
X-ray and MRI data from the 1970s and 1990s, albeit based on a few speakers and different
generations of speakers, confirm distinct tongue root productions for Akan vowels despite the

acoustic similarity; recent ultrasound data (Kirkham & Nance, 2017) confirm this for most vowel
pairs (i/ u/ o/ o/), but were not able to confirm it for the e/ or e/ distinctions due to
speakers adopting different articulatory strategies.10

This apparent near-merger raises the question of learnability. If the vowels are so hard to

perceive as different, how do Akan speakers learn to produce them differently? A recent study

of first language acquisition by nine Akan-speaking children (Asante-Twi dialect) aged three to
five years (Amoako, 2020) shows that these particular vowel distinctions may not necessarily be

the ones posing problems. Her results indicate that all +ATR vowels have a lower production
10

Kirkham and Nance (2017) describe the situation as follows: "An examination of individual speaker data shows two
divergent patterns amongst the Twi speakers: GF01 and GF02 produce /e/ slightly more advanced than //, whereas
GM01 and GM02 produce /e/ slightly more retracted than //. These patterns remain the same whether we use values extracted from the vowel midpoint or values extracted 80% into the vowel. There is also no clear correspondence
between the use of these two articulatory strategies and any patterns in tongue height, which suggests that the Twi
speakers may be particularly variable in the articulation of the /e / contrast, despite greater acoustic consistency
among speakers."

31

accuracy than -ATR vowels across the age groups and children. In particular, [] (she transcribes
this as [ae]) has the lowest accuracy rate of all vowels and is still not fully acquired by age five.
It is frequently substituted with either [], which fits with acoustic similarity, or with [a], its

harmonic counterpart, which may reflect lack of vowel harmony application for this vowel (as
noted in Section 1.4, the contexts where /a/ is harmonized to [] are restricted). This shows that
the acquisition of the allophonic vowel is delayed compared to the phonemic contrasts, which

may be a reflection of its more limited contextual environment and possible ongoing merger

with [e] from /e/ (Kpogo, 2022), rather than difficulty in perception. Interestingly, the other

[+ATR] vowels are commonly substituted with their [-ATR] counterparts, not the acoustically
similar but height-differing [-ATR] counterparts. For example, the word eda `fire' is produced
as [da] rather than [ da]. Although there are some sporadic cases of /o/ being pronounced
as [], or [e] as [], given what we know about adult perception, we might have expected a

far stronger tendency for these vowels to be merged in children's productions. Amoako (2020,
p. 130) notes that the children have acquired vowel harmony, and vowel substitutions tend to
respect it "even when there were errors in their production." This provides some supporting

evidence that vowel harmony is learned at a young age and appears to reinforce the distinction
between vowels by keeping them separated within words. We hypothesize that vowel harmony

may aid speakers in acquiring phonemic contrasts between acoustically similar vowels, such
as ATR+Height pairs / e/ and / o/. Nevertheless, if the author, as an adult Akan speaker,
transcribed the vowels based on her own perception, substitution errors between [e] and []

may not have been as readily perceived as between other vowels. Future acquisition work may
benefit from using acoustic measurements.

6. Conclusion
This is a large-scale study of the perception of Advanced Tongue Root vowel contrasts by speakers

of a language with ATR vowels and vowel harmony. Two experiments were conducted to test
perception of ATR contrasts in Akan: An AX task and an ABX task. The AX task (Experiment 1)

tested perception of monosyllables drawn from a related language (Gua), and participants were

told it was a different language than Akan. The ABX task (Experiment 2) tested perception of
bisyllables in the Akan language and participants were told it consisted of nonce Akan words.
The results show that participants were able to accurately perceive all vowel pairs that differed

based on only ATR in both experiments, even the pair a ~  that was not phonologically
contrastive. However, acoustically similar vowels  ~ e,  ~ o, and  ~  in Experiment 1, were
poorly perceived. This is so despite these vowel pairs being phonologically contrastive and

differing for two phonological features, vowel height and ATR. Similar results obtain for  ~ e,
 ~ o in Experiment 2.

Rose et al: Perception of ATR contrasts by Akan speakers

The results show that acoustic similarity in Akan vowels drives perception, rather than

phonological similarity or phonemic status. It provides supporting perceptual evidence that

some vowel pairs are so acoustically similar as to be practically merged, despite being produced
differently based on tongue root and larynx position. This constitutes a case of near merger
where production is different but perception shows a merger. The role of ATR vowel harmony

is important in Akan for maintaining the distinction between similar vowels. These vowels
commonly occur in words with other vowels that match them for ATR, respecting vowel harmony.

There are thus few instances where distinguishing, say, [e] from [], must occur in the absence of

other vowel cues. Nevertheless, we know from historical evidence in other languages that vowels
may exhibit merger despite the presence of vowel harmony, reducing nine vowel ATR systems to
seven (Elugbe, 1989). It remains to be seen whether Akan will move definitively in this direction.
